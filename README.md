## 🚀 About Me
I'm a data scientist and ML engineer specializing in **geospatial analytics**. Currently leading cross-functional teams at Negev Urban Research—MIT City Science Lab, where I build end-to-end data science tools for smart city and geoAI applications. 

My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge machine learning research (including a **NeurIPS publication**) and real-world geospatial challenges, leading data science platform development that supports evidence-based planning in the Negev region of Israel.
